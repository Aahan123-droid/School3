      <p>Human activity shapes the environment primarily through CO2 emissions. CO2 is a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere in high quantities 
        and causes heat to get trapped. Human activities such as burning coal and oil, i.e. fossil fuels, contribute to such emissions. Other 
        actions such as deforestation and pollution through excessive waste also participate in the climate crisis.Global warming causes 
        negative environmental events such as droughts, sea-levels rising, and damage to ecosystems. In turn, these events impact people’s
         lives, especially in the Global South, and cause displacement.</p>

    <p>Whether in the workplace, a sports tournament or a music competition, finishing in second place could make you the real winner in the 
      long run, a scientist has said. According to Chengwei Liu, associate professor of strategy and behavioural science at the Warwick 
      Business School, those who win often do so because of a fluke and they actually have inferior skills.</p>

          they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the
